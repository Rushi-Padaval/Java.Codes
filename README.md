# Java.Codes
My Java  Codes  That I Created For My Practice  I Used The Visual Studio Code.
In some codes files  i used the many comments the reason behind  it is to run next program after 1 code is run .  
i use comments for next code i will write there to avoid so many files ex.23.string.method.java
